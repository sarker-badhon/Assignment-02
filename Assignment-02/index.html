                <p class="intro">INTRODUCTION<span class="span-text">(copy text)</span> </p>
                <p></p>
                <p class="blog-introduction">At work, when people look 
                    at my screen and see it full of 
                    code, it's not unusual to get a 
                    comment about it looking very 
                    complicated or how clever I must 
                    be to understand it. The truth 
                    is, it's not that hard to learn how 
                    to write web pages and read 
                    the code used to create them; 
                    you certainly don't have to be a 
                    "programmer."
                    
                    Understanding HTML and CSS 
                    can help anyone who works 
                    with the web; designers can 
                    create more attractive and 
                    usable sites, website editors can 
                    create better content, marketers 
                    can communicate with their 
                    audience more effectively, and 
                    managers can commission 
                    better sites and get the best out 
                    of their teams.
                    
                    I've focussed on the code you 
                    need to use 90% of the time 
                    and omitted the code that you 
                    would rarely see even if writing 
                    websites is your full time job. By 
                    the end of the book, if you come 
                    across the other 10% you will be 
                    able to Google it to find out what 
                    it means quickly and easily.
                    
                    I have also added practical 
                    information on topics I am 
                    commonly asked about, such as 
                    how to prepare images, audio 
                    and video for the web, how to 
                    approach the design and build 
                    of a new site, how to improve 
                    your rankings in search engines 
                    (SEO), and how to use Google 
                    Analytics to learn about visitors 
                    to your site. 
                    
                    Many books that teach HTML and CSS 
                    resemble dull manuals. To make it easier for 
                    you to learn, we threw away the traditional 
                    template used by publishers and redesigned 
                    this book from scratch.
                    
                    Is It hard to Learn?</p>
